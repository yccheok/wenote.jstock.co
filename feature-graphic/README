Goal
====
Design various feature graphics (https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9866151?hl=en) to promote product https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yocto.wenote

We will use A/B testing to determine the single most optimal feature graphic.

The final feature graphic needs to have a better conversion rate than the current feature graphic - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yccheok/wenote.jstock.co/master/feature-graphic/current.png


The feature graphic needs to have following design elements
===========================================================

(1) Product name

"WeNote" (English)

"微筆記" (Traditional Chinese)

(2) Product icon

https://github.com/yccheok/wenote.jstock.co/blob/master/if_note_1296370.svg

(3) Icons to represent product features. Preferable to show them in sticky note form 

Example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yccheok/wenote.jstock.co/master/feature-graphic/sample0.png

The sticky notes shall be using the following background-color

#e53935 (red)
#fdd835 (yellow)
#5481e6 (blue)
#7cb342 (green)

Please use the following 4 icons

Note - https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material%20Icons%3Acalendar_month%3A
or https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material%20Icons%3Adescription%3A or https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material%20Icons%3Amenu%3A

Todo - https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons:check:

Calendar - https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material%20Icons%3Acalendar_month%3A

Reminder - https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material%20Icons%3Acalendar_month%3A

(4) Phone wireframe with screenshot. The phone wireframe should be minimalist. Try to test out with black/ white phone.

Traditional Chinese - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yccheok/wenote.jstock.co/master/feature-graphic/traditional%20chinese.png


Expectation
===========
My goal is to have a good-looking feature graphic. However, being able to convert well is way more important than being good-looking. Please kindly produce the following feature graphic variations, so that we can decide an optimal winner by using A/B testing.

1) With phone wireframe
2) Without phone wireframe
3) With rotated phone wireframe - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yccheok/wenote.jstock.co/master/feature-graphic/sample1.png
4) Perhaps test black/ white phone?
5) Perhaps test with various background creative?
6) ... (Any variations you feel will standout as A/B testing winner)

We will run the A/B testing in English (United States) Play store, and Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) Play store.
