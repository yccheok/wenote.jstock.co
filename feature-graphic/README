Design various feature graphics to promote product https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yocto.wenote

Please read through https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9866151?hl=en to understand the best practice of a good feature graphics.

We will use A/B testing to determine the single most optimal feature graphic for English play store, and single most optimal feature graphic for Traditional Chinese play store.

The final feature graphic needs to have a better conversion rate than the current feature graphic - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yccheok/wenote.jstock.co/master/feature-graphic/current.png


The feature graphic needs to have following design elements
===========================================================

(1) Product name

"WeNote" (English)

"微筆記" (Traditional Chinese)

(2) Product icon

(3) Icons to represent product features. Preferable to show them in sticky note form 

Example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yccheok/wenote.jstock.co/master/feature-graphic/sample0.png

The sticky notes shall be using the following background-color

#e53935 (red)
#fdd835 (yellow)
#5481e6 (blue)
#7cb342 (green)

Please use the following 4 icons

Expectation
===========
My goal is to have a good-looking feature graphic. However, being able to convert well is way more important than being good-looking. Please kindly produce multiple feature graphic variations, so that we can decide an optimal winner by using A/B testing.

1) With phone wireframe
2) Without phone wireframe
3) With rotated phone wireframe - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yccheok/wenote.jstock.co/master/feature-graphic/sample1.png
4) Perhaps test with various background creative? - https://hotpot.ai/templates/google-play-feature-graphic
5) ... (Any variations you feel will standout as A/B testing winner)

We will run the A/B testing in English (United States) Play store, and Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) Play store.
