How to resolve "Fix to prevent your app from being removed (5 days away)" due to "Subscriptions policy: Violation of Subscriptions policy"

On October 9, 2024, I received an email with the following details:

    Apps with subscriptions services or content need a clear UI/UX to ensure that users can easily find and choose the option they want. For example, if you sell subscriptions in your app(s), you must ensure that your app(s) clearly disclose how a user can manage or cancel their subscription. You must also include in your app access to an easy-to-use, online method to cancel the subscription.

    During our review, we found your app doesn’t comply with the Subscriptions policy in the following way:

        Your app has multiple screens in the purchase flow that lead users into accidentally clicking the subscribe button.

What I did is:

1. Fixed accordingly by relocating the subscription button position: https://github.com/yccheok/wenote.jstock.co/blob/master/review/Oct%2010%2C%202024.png

2. Submitted an appeal: https://github.com/yccheok/wenote.jstock.co/blob/master/review/Appeal%20submitted.png (Ticket number : 7-6844000037346)

On October 10, 2024, I received the appeal outcome:

    Thanks for contacting the Google Play team.

    Step 1: Fix the policy violation with your app

My thought is that the reviewer probably thinks the subscription button is still not far enough from the previous continue button.

I made another adjustment: https://github.com/yccheok/wenote.jstock.co/blob/master/review/Oct%2011%2C%202024.png

I also replied to the appeal email, stating I have made a new release. So far, there is no reply received yet.

The release was approved. However, the privacy warning message is still there: https://github.com/yccheok/wenote.jstock.co/blob/master/review/Privacy%20warning%20message.png

Since the deadline is only 5 days away, I am very worried about this. Can you advise how I can get in touch with Google to resolve this?

Thanks.
